# KPQA

This repository provides an evaluation metric for generative question answering systems based on our paper [KPQA: A Metric for Generative Question Answering Using Keyphrase Weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00192).
We provide the code to train KPQA, pretrained model, human annotated data and the code to compute KPQA-metric.

<h1> Usage </h1>

<h2> 1. Install Prerequisites </h2>
Install packages using "requirements.txt"

<h2> 2. Download Pretrained Model </h2>
We provide the pre-trained KPQA model in the following link. (TBD)

<h2> 3. Compute Metric </h2>
You can compute KPQA-metric using "compute_correlation.py"
