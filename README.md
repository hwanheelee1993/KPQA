# KPQA

This repository provides an evaluation metric or generative question answering systems based on our paper [KPQA: A Metric for Generative Question Answering Using Keyphrase Weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00192)
We provide the code to train KPQA, pretrained model, human annotated data and the code to compute KPQA-metric.
