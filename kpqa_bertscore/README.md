Automatic Evaluation Metric described in the paper [BERTScore: Evaluating Text Generation with BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675) (ICLR 2020).
#### News:
- Updated to version 0.3.1
  - A new `BERTScorer` object that caches the model to avoid re-loading it multiple times. Please see our [jupyter notebook example](./example/Demo.ipynb) for the usage.
  - Supporting multiple reference sentences for each example. The `score` function now can take a list of lists of strings as the references and return the score between the candidate sentence and its closest reference sentence.
- Updated to version 0.3.0
  - Supporting *Baseline Rescaling*: we apply a simple linear transformation to enhance the readability of BERTscore using pre-computed "baselines". It has been pointed out (e.g. by #20, #23) that the numercial range of BERTScore is exceedingly small when computed with RoBERTa models. In other words, although BERTScore correctly distinguish examples through ranking, the numerical scores of good and bad examples are very similar. We detail our approach in [a separate post](./journal/rescale_baseline.md).
- Updated to version 0.2.3
  - Supporting DistilBERT (Sanh et al.), ALBERT (Lan et al.), and XLM-R (Conneau et al.) models.
  - Including the version of huggingface's transformers in the hash code for reproducibility
- BERTScore gets accepted in ICLR 2020. Please come to our poster in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia!
- Updated to version 0.2.2
  - **Bug fixed**: when using RoBERTaTokenizer, we now set `add_prefix_space=True` which was the default setting in huggingface's `pytorch_transformers` (when we ran the experiments in the paper) before they migrated it to `transformers`. This breaking change in `transformers` leads to a lower correlation with human evalutation. To reproduce our RoBERTa results in the paper, please use version `0.2.2`.
  - The best number of layers for DistilRoBERTa is included
  - Supporting loading a custom model
- Updated to version 0.2.1
  - [SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert) (Beltagy et al.) models are now included. Thanks to AI2 for sharing the models. By default, we use the 9th layer (the same as BERT-base), but this is not tuned. 
- Our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675) has been updated to v2 with more experiments and analysis.
- Updated to version 0.2.0
  - Supporting BERT, XLM, XLNet, and RoBERTa models using [huggingface's Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
  - Automatically picking the best model for a given language
  - Automatically picking the layer based a model
  - IDF is *not* set as default as we show in the new version that the improvement brought by importance weighting is not consistent

### Overview
BERTScore leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT and matches
words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity.
It has been shown to correlate with human judgment on setence-level and
system-level evaluation.
Moreover, BERTScore computes precision, recall, and F1 measure, which can be
useful for evaluating different language generation tasks.

For an illustration, BERTScore precision can be computed as

### Installation
* Python version >= 3.6
* PyTorch version >= 1.0.0

Install from pypi with pip by 

```sh
pip install bert-score
```
Install latest unstable version from the master branch on Github by:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score
```

Install it from the source by:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score
cd bert_score
pip install .
```
and you may test your installation by:
```
python -m unittest discover
```

### Usage

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
We provide a command line interface (CLI) of BERTScore as well as a python module. 
For the CLI, you can use it as follows:
1. To evaluate English text files:

We provide example inputs under `./example`.

```sh
bert-score -r example/refs.txt -c example/hyps.txt --lang en
```
You will get the following output at the end:

roberta-large_L17_no-idf_version=0.3.0(hug_trans=2.3.0) P: 0.957378 R: 0.961325 F1: 0.959333

where "roberta-large_L17_no-idf_version=0.3.0(hug_trans=2.3.0)" is the hash code.

Starting from version 0.3.0, we support rescaling the scores with baseline scores

```sh
bert-score -r example/refs.txt -c example/hyps.txt --lang en --rescale-with-baseline
```
You will get:

roberta-large_L17_no-idf_version=0.3.0(hug_trans=2.3.0)-rescaled P: 0.747044 R: 0.770484 F1: 0.759045 

This makes the range of the scores larger and more human-readable. Please see this [post](./journal/rescale_baseline.md) for details.


2. To evaluate text files in other languages:

We currently support the 104 languages in multilingual BERT ([full list](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md#list-of-languages)).

Please specify the two-letter abbrevation of the language. For instance, using `--lang zh` for Chinese text. 

See more options by `bert-score -h`.


3. To load your own custom model:
Please specify the path to the model and the number of layers to use by `--model` and `--num_layers`.
```sh
bert-score -r example/refs.txt -c example/hyps.txt --model path_to_my_bert --num_layers 9
```


4. To visualize matching scores:
```sh
bert-score-show --lang en -r "There are two bananas on the table." -c "On the table are two apples." -f out.png
```
The figure will be saved to out.png.

#### Python Function
For the python module, we provide a [demo](./example/Demo.ipynb). 
Please refer to [`bert_score/score.py`](./bert_score/score.py) for more details.

Running BERTScore can be computationally intensive (because it uses BERT :p).
Therefore, a GPU is usually necessary. If you don't have access to a GPU, you
can try our [demo on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kpL8Y_AnUUiCxFjhxSrxCsc6-sDMNb_Q)


#### Practical Tips

* Report the hash code (e.g., `roberta-large_L17_no-idf_version=0.2.1`) in your paper so that people know what setting you use. This is inspired by [sacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacreBLEU).
* Unlike BERT, RoBERTa uses GPT2-style tokenizer which creates addition " " tokens when there are multiple spaces appearing together. It is recommended to remove addition spaces by `sent = re.sub(r' +', ' ', sent)` or `sent = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', sent)`.
* Using inverse document frequency (idf) on the reference
  sentences to weigh word importance  may correlate better with human judgment.
  However, when the set of reference sentences become too small, the idf score 
  would become inaccurate/invalid.
  We now make it optional. To use idf,
  please set `--idf` when using the CLI tool or
  `idf=True` when calling `bert_score.score` function.
* When you are low on GPU memory, consider setting `batch_size` when calling
  `bert_score.score` function.
* To use a particular model please set `-m MODEL_TYPE` when using the CLI tool
  or `model_type=MODEL_TYPE` when calling `bert_score.score` function. 
* We tune layer to use based on WMT16 metric evaluation dataset. You may use a
  different layer by setting `-l LAYER` or `num_layers=LAYER`
* __Limitation__: Because BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM with learned positional embeddings are pre-trained on sentences with max length 512, BERTScore is undefined between sentences longer than 510 (512 after adding \[CLS\] and \[SEP\] tokens). The sentences longer than this will be truncated. Please consider using XLNet which can support much longer inputs.
